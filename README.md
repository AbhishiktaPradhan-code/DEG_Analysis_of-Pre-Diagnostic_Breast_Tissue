#  Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes in Histologically Normal Breast Tissue Prior to Cancer Onset

##  Project Overview

This study aims to identify early transcriptional changes in histologically normal breast tissues of breast cancer patients versus controls. Using RNA-seq data and differential gene expression analysis.

This project analyzes RNA-seq data from 10 human samples (5 susceptible, 5 control) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The analysis was conducted using a Galaxy-based RNA-seq pipeline, followed by DESeq2 analysis in R.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  MA Plot

<img src="https://github.com/AbhishiktaPradhan-code/DEG_Analysis_of-Pre-Diagnostic_Breast_Tissue/blob/main/results/plots/MA%20Plot.png" width="500"/>

The MA plot displays the log2 fold change versus the average gene expression (mean normalized counts). Most genes are clustered around a log2FC of 0, indicating no differential expression. A subset of genes stands out with significant upregulation or downregulation (highlighted in blue), reflecting strong transcriptional changes between the susceptible and control groups.

###  Volcano Plot

<img src="https://github.com/AbhishiktaPradhan-code/DEG_Analysis_of-Pre-Diagnostic_Breast_Tissue/blob/main/results/plots/volcano_plot_top30.png" width="500"/>


The volcano plot visualizes the distribution of genes based on their â€“log10 adjusted p-value (y-axis) and log2 fold change (x-axis). Genes that are both highly significant and strongly differentially expressed appear at the corners of the plot. The top 30 genes with the lowest adjusted p-values are highlighted, showing a balanced mix of upregulated and downregulated genes.

###  PCA Plot

<img src="https://github.com/AbhishiktaPradhan-code/DEG_Analysis_of-Pre-Diagnostic_Breast_Tissue/blob/main/results/plots/pca_plot_labeled.png" width="500"/>

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows a clear separation between control and susceptible samples, with PC1 explaining 79% of the total variance. Samples cluster tightly by condition, suggesting high within-group consistency and strong condition-driven transcriptomic differences. This supports the biological validity of the differential expression analysis.
